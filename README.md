## a simple place to start

This document is intended for readers who know at least a little bit of a couple of things:

- a scripting language like JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Perl, etc. If you aren't a programmer yet then it is probably easier to start by reading [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/). :cat2:
- git and github. These are the open source collaboration tools that people in the node community use to share modules. You just need to know the basics. Here are three great intro tutorials: [1](http://skli.se/2012/09/22/introduction-to-git/), [2](http://zachbruggeman.me/github-for-cats/), [3](http://opensourcerer.diy.org/)

This short book is a work in progress. If you like it then please **give me a dollar** via [gittip](https://www.gittip.com/maxogden/) so that I can justify taking the time to write more!
